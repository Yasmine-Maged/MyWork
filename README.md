# MyWork
For Question2: API
Using Postman I have created the test cases with the required HTTP methods (POST - GET - PUT - DELETE) and with the given endpoints in Swagger, and by checking the Expected results and the Actual results I found that 3 Testscases passed and 1 testcase failed.
You can check Petstore.postman_collection.json file to find collection created.
